# Secret keys for verifying the integrity of signed cookies and generating user passwords.
# If you change the secret token, all old signed cookies will become invalid!
# Make sure each secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can generate cryptographically secure secret keys with `rake secret`.
